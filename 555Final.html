<h1 style="text-align: center; color: black; font-weight:bold;"> Arlington's Charlie Clark <a href="https://library.arlingtonva.us/charlie-clark-center-for-local-history/">Center for Local History</a>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Introduction and Background </h2>

	<p> For my project I chose to focus on Arlington’s Charlie Clark Center for Local History. I chose this location specifically because I worked there previously as an intern from 2022-2023. I wrote historical blog posts, worked the reference desk, and performed archival research and processing of the collections there. It was just recently renamed to honor Charlie Clark, a long time Arlington resident and local historian. </p>
	<p> The Center for Local history was implemented in the 1980s as a way for locals to learn about and understand the area’s rich cultural and historical past. Located within the Central Library of Arlington, the CLH now serves as a mix of a research library and community archives. Held within the collections are almost anything that is related to Arlington’s community history, including rare books, community records, and genealogy materials. In addition to the research library, the CLH holds an off site storage facility for archival records that can be requested through a reference request. Users are allowed to view archival material and books in the research library but are not allowed to check materials out. </p>
	<p> A part of <a href="https://library.arlingtonva.us/">Arlington Public Library</a> , The Center for Local History (CLH) serves the Arlington community by preserving the County's cultural and historical heritage. The stated mission of the CLH is that, “The Charlie Clark Center for Local History (CCCLH) collects, preserves, and shares resources that illustrate Arlington County’s history, diversity and communities. Librarians and archivists develop collections of unique research material and make them available for use by residents, students, teachers, genealogists, scholars, authors, journalists and anyone interested in learning more about Arlington County.” </p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Collections </h2>

	<p> For this project I think it’s important to understand exactly what the CLH is holding within its massive collections. These collections are frequently used by historians, authors, genealogists, and regular locals who want to learn more about the area that they live in. </p>
	<p> Some of the most popular collections that are requested are the 9/11 first responders oral histories, the records of local businesses, civic organizations, and churches, as well as the personal collections of activists and elected officials. The two largest collections there are the Virginia genealogy books and the Arlington Subject Files which have a wide range of information on almost any topic related to Arlington. Below you can see a photo of a plane flying over what is now the Pentagon, as well as the personal photos of an unknown Arlington man from 1915. </p>

<br>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Current System </h2>

	<p> The information system that the CLH uses is based underneath the umbrella of the Arlington Public Libraries, because of its location in the Central Library. The system is consistent with standard library search catalogs, with a simple search functionality that can access the collections of all library locations within the Arlington Public Libraries. If you go on any Arlington library website and search for a topic, it will search the entire APL collections unless narrowed down to the CLH. </p>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PalumboA8/FinalPictures/58ef001c83423b46fbe057e41f80ec05e2ff4c7a/Available%20At.jpeg" style="border:3px solid black;vertical-align: middle;height: 300px; width: 500px">

	<p> Once you select the CLH, you can break it down further into the genre, series, and shelf locations. The CLH information system works like a typical library system, showing the availability, location, and other general information about the cataloged material. </p>
	<p> This shows how everything can be broken up, and gives a behind the scenes look at how the CLH collections are organized internally. Within genres, you can see biographies, genealogy, fiction, obituaries, yearbooks, and periodicals, which all might be of interest for the theoretical user. Within the series, it shows regimental histories, county records, marriage registers, and other categories of interest. </p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Evaluation </h2>

	<p> The information system that the CLH and APL use are not unique to them. It follows the basic standard formats that most public libraries across the country follow. This consistency allows for increased usability with little recall actually needed to work the website. Intuition is easily followed to achieve the desired goals. This system is interesting because of it's merger between the ACPL and CLH databases. While most archives have a separate designated database that is often underfunded or underutilized, the CLH has bypassed those problems by being under the ACPL umbrella. This allows for better behind the scenes support than a typical standalone archives that does all the work themselves. However, this leads to much of the archival information to be shoehorned into the library categories. As archival content is often more complex, this presents issues for the non-typical archival collections. </p>

	<ul> Pros
			<li> It can allow a wide variety of users to access a unique set of information related to local history. </li>
			<li> Easy to learn and accessible for patrons as it was integrated into existing library collections systems. </li>
	</ul>
	
	<ul> Cons
			<li> It does not show archival collections that are unprocessed or in progress. </li>
			<li> Users are not able to check out material and must work supervised in CLH reading room. </li>
			<li> The integrated system can sometimes confuse patrons. </li>
	</ul>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Project Motivation </h2>

	<p> As technology advances in the 21st century, an increasing amount of donated collections are completely born digital. This adds unique challenges for the staff, because while it is already digitized, the long term storage and publishing of digital born collections are still being worked out today. Problems such as degradation, obsolescence, and the cost of servers are issues to consider when working with digital material. The system that the CLH uses cannot handle the upload of ALL the collections, so a certain choice has to be made on what is available and what is not. </p>
	<p> As a former member of the CCCLH staff, I have many experiences working with the information system that they use. Backend users need much more technological experience and training in order to effectively use the systems in place. This largely comes down to the fact that the archival database is mixed in with the regular library database. For the collections to show up in a library search, each digitized archival object needs to be MARC readable. The CLH is not blessed with the funding or the staff of a national institution, so there is only one full time staff member assigned to digization duties. The Digital Archivist duties include scanning, uploading, and researching each photo and document that is uploaded, so the users can have as much information as possible. Additionally, the Digital Archivist needs to manually add metadata from the images/objects into the library catalog. This includes all technological information as well as the background and history of the item. This leads to incredibly strict standards on what actually is digitized or not, because limited staffing availabilty means the CLH can only focus on a certain amount of items. This leads to digizing only the items that we have the most information on, rather than the whole collections that are actually available.
	<p> Much of the user end problems that I identified for this project relate to the problems and failings of the staff end. Because of the miniscule amount of information that has actually been digitized compared to the full collections, many people in Arlington do not even know about the CCCLH. People often stumble across it by accident when searching for local history books, and find that the only copy available is in the reading room of the CCCLH. While the overall usability of the site is standard and consistent with other library sites, this does not help the user to search for material within the collection. General searches on the <a href="https://library.arlingtonva.us/">Arlington Public Library</a> website will include results from the CCCLH, but it often does not specify clearly enough that the materials cannot be checked out and need to be viewed in person. Additionally, there are mountains of content that are unavailable to users because of a lack of information, lack of staffing, and lack of interest.

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> D.R.O.I.D </h2>

<img src="https://www.projecttracks.be/images/droid_2_start.png" style="border:3px solid black;vertical-align: middle;height: 300px; width: 300px">

	<p> The tool that I recommend be added to the CLH is the Digital Record Object Identifier, or DROID. It’s a free, open source software that was created in 2005 by the UK National Archives Digital Preservation Department. Its main function is to perform automated batch identification of file formats.</p>
	<p> It works by using internal signatures to identify and report the specific file format and version of digital files. These signatures are stored in an XML signature file, generated from information recorded in their technical registry. </p>
	<p>  It is a file profiling tool that can identify the file type, name, extensions, size, and last modification date of any digital object in a given dataset. Its role is to identify risks in users’ data and to aid the user in planning migration, not to facilitate the actual migration process. </p>
	<p> The National Archives describes it as being “Designed to meet the fundamental requirement of any digital repository to be able to identify the precise format of all stored digital objects, and to link that identification to a central registry of technical information about that format and its dependencies.” </p>
	<p> DROID 6.5 onwards provides two download options for users. The first is embedded with Java for Windows and does not require Java to be installed to run,the second can be run on any system with Java already installed. (DROID has been tested on Linux, Microsoft Windows, and Mac).
	<p> After downloading, using DROID is incredibly easy and intuitive. There is a simple user interface that allows the user to upload large batches of data and select the material they would like to see in the report. After that, pressing the "Run" button will automatically comb through the uploaded files for metadata and presents it to you in a comprehensive report. </p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> How does it help? </h2>

	<p> While DROID was built purely to preform automated batch identification of file formats, it can be used for a variety of other tasks as well. DROID helps to find duplicate materials, at risk or obsolete formats, and also fully sports auto and manual metadata creation by generating only from embedded information, not external repositories. It really just helps to overall manage an institution's digital information more efficiently. This would have massive benefits for an organization such as the CCCLH, that operates with a small budget and staff compared to it's collections. </p>
	<p> First, the DROID tool is extremely easy to learn and use compared to other similar tools. Unlike the others that work with command line instructions, DROID has a simple user interface that the Digital Archivist can easily learn. They could use this tool in order to automate much of the manual metadata work that they have been completing by hand for years. By allowing DROID to collect much of the general information such as file type, date, and other behind the scenes data, it would free up time for the digital archivist to complete more complex tasks. The information reports generated by DROID are produced with Mircosoft Excel, which is easily transferrable to the CCCLH information systems. This tool also has the opportunity to help with the task of digitization in general. Like I mentioned, an increasing amout of donated collection are born digital. The process of transferring the donated materials from flash drives, google drives, or hard drives could be greatly assisted through the DROID tool. Although it doesn't physically help with the migration, it assists in planning by finding any corrupted files, at risk data, or duplicate materials. By identifying these issues early on, it can save resources and time spent on physically combing through the newly accessioned materials. Even if the material cannot be fully digitized, the informtion can be used to create finding aids which are easily digizited.
	<p> For the user, it would assist them, although indirectly, by greatly increasing the amount of information that is presented to them when searching in the CLH catalog. One of the most common problems that researchers run into at the CLH is not knowing exactly where to look. They instead rely on the research archivist, who cannot handle the amount of online requests and the front desk responsibilities that they have. By greatly increasing the amount of collections available online and the information accompanying them, it will allow users to do much of the work on their own time, instead of relying on the staff.

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Conclusion </h2>
	<p> The Charlie Clark Center for Local History operates as a hybrid community archives and research library. Held within it's collections are anything and everything related to Arlington County history - including revolutionary regiment histories, Civil War fortification information, and many collections ranging from local World War Two era poets to the community fight against the building of I-66. These collections vary in size and type, ranging from small photobooks to massive collections of born digital business records. </p>
	<p> Organized as branch of the Arlington Public Libraries, the Center for Local History is benefitted greatly by being under the control and guidance of a larger institution like the County Libraies. This affords them much more name recognition, reach, funding, and support than a standalone archives. This is evidenced most by the CLH's inclusion within the APL library website and catalog. With searchable collections of digitized materials, the CCCLH can dissemniate their knowledge and information to the entire county. While it does have it's obvious benefits, there are drawbacks for the staff who use it. The strict standards that are required to make archival metadata fit into MARC readable langauge severely limit the amount of information that can be put onto the website. This hurts both users trying to find information and staff trying to serve the public more effectively. </p>
	<p> To combat some of these issues, I recommend that the Digital Record Object Identification (DROID) tool be implemented into their information and collections system. Although it's main function is batch identification of file formats, it can also serve a variety of function that would speed up the digitization and accessioning process of materials. With a limited staff, the CLH needs to evaluate the DROID tool as a possible avenue for increased digization. By automating many of the tedious practices, they can free up the valuable time of their archivist to do other tasks. </p>
